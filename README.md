ü©∫ **Insulin Pump Simulation**

A C++/Qt-based simulation of an insulin pump system, featuring real-time data flow, bolus calculation, battery management, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) visualization. This project models key components of an insulin pump, designed for educational purposes and prototyping embedded system concepts.

üöÄ **Features**

**Real-Time Data Flow**: Simulates insulin delivery and CGM data updates in a time-driven system.

**Bolus Calculation**: Implements insulin bolus dosing based on user input and glucose levels.

**Battery Management**: Models battery state and power usage over time.

**Interactive UI**: Uses Qt to display glucose readings, insulin doses, and system status.

üõ†Ô∏è **How to Run**

**Prerequisites**

C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

Qt libraries (tested with Qt 5.x or 6.x)

make (included Makefile)
